User intent and purpose, who/what it is catering for:
Purpose of the discover more page is so that fans or people who are interested to find out more about Eve can click on it and check out other relevant infos (in the about me page) as well as being able to see past concert photos and videos from his tours, giving them an idea of how its like to be at his concerts. 
I also revamped the announcment sections so that it shows his latest album "Under Blue", since he had a separate website for it but not on the official, i just added that to my website so easier for reference sake. 
To celebrate his release of the new album, he collaborated with different artists to draw illustrations for every song in his album. However, he only posted that on his social medias but not on the websites. Therefore, i wanted to showcase it on the website since all the artworks are really nice. All these features would be useful for Eve fans or anyone who wants to be updated on the latest news or songs/album as well as looking back or checking out concert pictures, artworks and videos
